### A zero-knowledge, offline-first personal finance tracker in a single HTML file.

Expense Titan is designed for users who want granular control over their financial data without the bloat of cloud services, subscription fees, or privacy-invasive tracking.

## Why Expense Titan?

Modern finance tools are bloated. They require logins, sync to servers you don't control, and lock essential features behind paywalls. 

Expense Titan exists because tracking your spending should be a utility, not a product. It stores your data locally in your browser. No one else sees it. No one else owns it.

### The Utility Gap

| **Before** | **After** |
| :--- | :--- |
| Spreadsheets are ugly and hard to manage on mobile. | A responsive interface that looks good on any screen. |
| Cloud apps sell your data to advertisers. | 100% LocalStorage. Zero network traffic for data. |
| "Premium" features are locked behind $10/month. | Full access to Analytics, Budgeting, and Exporting for free. |
| Requires complex installation or Python environments. | A single `index.html` file. Double-click to run. |
